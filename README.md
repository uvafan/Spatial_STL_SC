# Spatial SSTL for Smart Cities
This project seeks to develop a sophisticated and useful tool for satisfaction checking of signal trace data across Smart Cities. It will provide a framework for the automated processing of design requirements of Smart Cities (such as those in safety, pollution, traffic, etc. domains), create a custom network graph for the processing of signal trace data, and perform a novel model checking algorithm over that graph to assess the degree of satisfaction of the cities' requirements.

Required packages:
  - OSMnx
  - Networkx
  - Imposm


This project is in progress under the supervision of Professors Lu Feng and John Stankovic at the University of Virginia, with 
direction from PhD candidate Meiyi Ma and assistance from undergraduate researchers Eli Lifland and Timothy Davison.
