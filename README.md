# Running the tool
Python3 is required.
First make sure requirements are fulfilled:  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
Due to dependency issues (see https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx/issues/45), you may need to manually fix an OSError using sudo apt install python3-rtree on Ubuntu or brew install libspatialindex on MacOS.  
Then, run gui.py.
# Using the tool

Use the "Show Map" button to view the points that have been entered.
